# 🚀 Using Dagger for Reusable, Portable CI/CD Pipelines

## 🏗️ Introduction to Dagger’s Approach to CI/CD as Code

[Dagger](https://docs.dagger.io/) is an **open-source runtime for composable workflows**, designed to create **repeatable, modular, observable, and cross-platform CI/CD pipelines**. By defining CI/CD workflows as code, Dagger enables:

✅ **Reusable Workflows** – Define once, use anywhere across projects and teams.
✅ **Portable Execution** – Run workflows **locally, in any CI system, or in the cloud** without modifications.
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Leverage **automatic artifact caching** for efficient execution.
✅ **Built-in Observability** – Gain real-time insights via **logs, tracing, and metrics**.

Dagger treats CI/CD workflows as **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)** 🕸️, where each step is a node in the graph, ensuring **clear dependencies** and **optimized execution**.

## 📌 Dagger Components Overview

The **Dagger Engine** is the core runtime, responsible for executing workflows using a **universal type system** and **data layer**. It runs on any OCI-compatible system and is controlled via the Dagger API. Dagger has the following key components:

- **Dagger Engine**: The core runtime that powers Dagger pipelines.
- **Dagger SDKs**: Use Python, Go, or Node.js to define pipelines.
- **Containerized Execution**: Each step runs in an isolated, reproducible environment.
- **Dagger API**: A GraphQL-based universal type system for defining workflows.

## 🌍 Real-World Example: Deploying Terraform with Dagger

### 🏗️ Scenario

Deploy Terraform infrastructure using Dagger while keeping the pipeline portable and repeatable.

#### 🔨 Steps

- **Clone the repository** 📂
- **Define the Dagger pipeline** ⚙️
- **Run Terraform with Dagger** 🚀

### 🖥️ Example Workflow

### 🎯 Expected Outcome

✅ Terraform initializes and validates the configuration.
✅ Infrastructure is provisioned automatically.
✅ The same pipeline can be executed locally or in CI/CD environments without modification.

## 🎉 Conclusion

Dagger provides an innovative way to write, manage, and execute CI/CD pipelines as code. By leveraging its graph-based execution model, containerized steps, and multi-platform support, platform engineers can:

🚀 Build reusable and scalable pipelines
🌎 Run workflows anywhere (local/cloud/CI systems)
🔄 Ensure consistency across deployments🛠️ Easily integrate Terraform, OpenTofu, or Pulumi

With Dagger, your CI/CD logic stays the same, whether you’re deploying locally or on a cloud platform. Happy building! 🏗️🚀
