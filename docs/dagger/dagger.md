# 🚀 Using Dagger for Reusable, Portable CI/CD Pipelines

Welcome to the documentation on [Dagger](https://docs.dagger.io/), an **open-source runtime for composable workflows**. But what does that mean exactly? Stick around and we will cover that and more. Dagger is very intriguing if you think about the current developer workflow for CI/CD pipelines. Using something like GitHub Actions, we need to define a YAML template (and we all know how much developers love YAML 😉) and push it as many times as it takes to get a first working version of it.

There are many factors that play into why this is challenging. To name one, the workflow agent where the CI/CD pipeline will run is very likely not the same as the environment you develop in, leading to ‘dependency hell’. There is where Dagger is intriguing. CI/CD pipelines are containerized making it incredibly portable.

From the creators of Docker, lets have a look at how Dagger works in practice.

## 🏗️ Introduction to Dagger’s Approach to CI/CD as Code

As mentioned above, Dagger is an **open-source runtime for composable workflows**, designed to create **repeatable, modular, observable, and cross-platform CI/CD pipelines**. By defining CI/CD workflows as code, Dagger enables:

✅ **Reusable Workflows** – Define once, use anywhere across projects and teams.
✅ **Portable Execution** – Run workflows **locally, in any CI system, or in the cloud** without modifications.
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Leverage **automatic artifact caching** for efficient execution.
✅ **Built-in Observability** – Gain real-time insights via **logs, tracing, and metrics**.

Since Dagger leverages containers, what runs locally is will be the same as what runs in the cloud (ie: GitHub Actions). This solves a huge challenge for developers making the writing, testing, and deployment of CI/CD pipelines much easier. Dagger is also platform agnostic allowing you to switch platforms as needed, avoiding CI lock-in

## 📌 Dagger Components Overview

The **Dagger Engine** is the core runtime, responsible for executing workflows using a **universal type system** and **data layer**. It runs on any OCI-compatible system and is controlled via the Dagger API. Dagger has the following key components:

- **Dagger Engine**: The core runtime that powers Dagger pipelines.
- **Dagger SDKs**: Use Python, Go, or Node.js to define pipelines.
- **Containerized Execution**: Each step runs in an isolated, reproducible environment.
- **Dagger API**: A GraphQL-based universal type system for defining workflows.
- **DaggerVerse**: An easy way to search and consume modules

## 🌍 Real-World Example: Deploying Terraform with Dagger

### 🏗️ Scenario

Deploy Terraform infrastructure using Dagger while keeping the pipeline portable and repeatable.

#### 🔨 Steps

- **Clone the repository** 📂
- **Define the Dagger pipeline** ⚙️
- **Run Terraform with Dagger** 🚀

### 🖥️ Example Workflow

### 🎯 Expected Outcome

✅ Terraform initializes and validates the configuration.
✅ Infrastructure is provisioned automatically.
✅ The same pipeline can be executed locally or in CI/CD environments without modification.

## 🎉 Conclusion

Dagger provides an innovative way to write, manage, and execute CI/CD pipelines as code. By leveraging its graph-based execution model, containerized steps, and multi-platform support, platform engineers can:

🚀 Build reusable and scalable pipelines
🌎 Run workflows anywhere (local/cloud/CI systems)
🔄 Ensure consistency across deployments🛠️ Easily integrate Terraform, OpenTofu, or Pulumi

With Dagger, your CI/CD logic stays the same, whether you’re deploying locally or on a cloud platform. Happy building! 🏗️🚀
