## Overview of Internal Developer Platforms and Platform Tooling Landscape

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are centralized platforms that provide developers with self-service access to the tools, environments, and resources they need for development. These platforms are designed to streamline workflows, reduce friction, and enhance productivity by offering a cohesive and integrated development experience.

### Key Features of Internal Developer Platforms

- **Self-Service Access**: Developers can easily access and provision the resources they need without relying on other teams.
- **Standardization**: Ensures consistency across development environments, reducing configuration drift and errors.
- **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks such as environment setup, deployment, and testing.
- **Scalability**: Supports scaling of applications and infrastructure to meet changing demands.
- **Security**: Integrates security best practices and compliance checks into the development process.

### Platform Tooling Landscape

The platform tooling landscape encompasses a variety of tools and technologies that support the development, deployment, and management of applications. Key categories include:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Bicep and Pulumi for managing and provisioning infrastructure through code.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI for automating code integration, testing, and validation.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Tools like Argo CD, Spinnaker, and Harness for automating the deployment process to production.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog for monitoring system performance and gaining insights into application behavior.
- **Security and Compliance**: Tools like Snyk, Aqua Security, and HashiCorp Vault for integrating security measures and compliance checks.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet for automating repetitive tasks and configuration management.
- **Cloud-Native Architectures**: Tools like Kubernetes, Istio, and Helm for orchestrating containerized applications and managing microservices.
- **Internal Development Platforms**: Tools like Backstage, Humanitec, and Port for creating and managing internal developer platforms.
